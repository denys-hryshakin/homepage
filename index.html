                      <p><q>People talk about tactics, but when you look at it, tactics are just players. You change things so that the team can get the most out of the skills they have to offer, but you don't go any further than that. The fundamentals, what I want, which is to take the ball, try to play as offensive as possible and dominate the game through the ball, is the same. I grew up with that; I was a player with that idea, and I am a coach with that idea.

                  <h3>FAVOURITE SON OF SANTPEDOR</h3>
                  <p class="tags small">Pep Guardiola hails from the small Catalan town of Santpedor in north-east Spain. And the home ground of local team CF Santpedor is now called Camp Municipal Josep Guardiola in honour of Guardiola’s achievements. The municipal council also named Guardiola their “favourite son of the town” in October 2009.</p>

                  <h3>CROUCH, THAT HURT!</h3>
                  <p class="tags small">Who is Pep’s favourite striker? Messi? Nope. Lewandoski? Nope. Augero? Nope. It’s Peter Crouch. During the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Guardiola wrote a series of columns for El Pais where he gushed over a favourite striker from the tournament, the lanky Crouch. “Wayne Rooney is perhaps more decisive and beautiful to watch,” he wrote, “but what’s certain is that Crouch conditions you more. With Crouch, you have to play to Crouch’s game. And playing to Crouch’s game gives you a lot.”</p>

                  <h3>NO AUTOGRAPH FOR PEP</h3>
                  <p class="tags small">Guardiola was once refused an autograph by Michel Platini, when offered a poster of the Frenchman, while doing ball-boy duties. Platini’s poster adorned Guardiola’s childhood wall.</p>

                  <h3>HIS LOVE SUITS HIM WELL</h3>
                  <p class="tags small">Guardiola’s relationship with wife Cristina Serra grew around the latter’s family clothes shop in Manresa, in Spain’s north east. And that’s the secret to his smart dapper looks.  Christine is heiress to the family owned clothing boutique Serra Claret and is responsible for his dressing sense. Ah, he also got featured in the cover of Spanish edition of GQ, the men’s magazine.</p>

                  <h3>THE AUTHOR</h3>
                  <p class="tags small">‘La meva gent, el meu futbol’ (my people, my football) – Ever heard of this book? Well, it’s authored by Pep along with two respected football journalists from Spain – Lu Martin and Miguel Rico. Released in 2001, the book is so difficult to find that it will cost you thousands of dollars even if you manage you find it. Its only available in Catalan but it’s out of print and Pep doesn’t want it republished.</p>
